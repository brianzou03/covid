Welcome to my Covid-19 screening application askcovid19now.com! This application will remain <strong>free</strong> forever. Let me introduce myself - Iâ€™m <strong>Brian Zou</strong>, a senior at South Pasadena High School. You may be wondering, why did I create this application? It's rather simple for me, honestly. I wanted to help the community, and what better way than to do something I love (programming), and apply this application to one of my favorite volunteer organizations - Asian Youth Center (AYC)? Since I had some free time, I got to work, writing the code to the very site you are currently on. I hope that this application has helped you narrow down your ailment. Good luck in your fight against COVID-19!</p>
